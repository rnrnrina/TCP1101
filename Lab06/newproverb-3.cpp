// LAB 6.2 Introduction to Pass by Value
// This program will allow the user to input from the keyboard
// whether the last word to the following proverb should be party or country:
// "Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their ___"
// Inputting a 1 will use the word party. Any other number will use the word country.

// ---6.2.3 Change the previous program so the user may input the word to end the phrase. The string holding the userâ€™s input word will be passed to the proverb function instead of passing a number to it. Notice that this change requires you to change the proverb function heading and the prototype as well as the call to the function.
